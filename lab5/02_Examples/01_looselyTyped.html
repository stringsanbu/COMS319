  // TODO: OBSERVE that
  //  (a) we can use the keyword var to declare a variable
  //  BTW, this is useful when we declare local variables in functions.
  //  (b) we can also initialize a variable and use it (without var)
  //  (c) the type depends on the value and determined at run-time
  //  (d) the type can change at run-time
