<!-- 
  THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXAMPLE IS TO SHOW TWO THINGS:
  a) The order in which js scripts are run and pages are rendered
  b) understand local and global variables in js

  Document is "ready" as soon as  DOM is ready. However, Onload action
  happens after all external files have been loaded (mainly image files
  etc) - and is later than when the DOM is ready.

  Note that although use of var for a variable may occur AFTER a use of
  the variable - it is STILL considered a LOCAL variable.
  Take the example of i in function test(). It is set to 3, and then
  a var is used. It is a local variable and the print of i OUTSIDE test
  shows 2 (the global variable result).

// We are adding an event listener for the READY event here
// We will learn (later) other ways to add such listeners
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {

The following is printed to console:<br>

2  In head element<br>
3  in script1 in body<br>
4  in script2 in body<br>
5  in test0.js  'time'<br>
6 This should be the third to last log (not counting picture errors)<br>
7 Document is now ready, this should be the second to last log to console (not counting picture errors) 'time'<br>
8 Document has now been loaded completely!--This should be the last log to console 'time'<br>
